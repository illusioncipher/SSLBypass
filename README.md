## Introduction

SSL Unpining is a security measure used in mobile and web applications to enhance SSL/TLS connections. It involves associating a specific SSL certificate or public key with a server, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. This is achieved by hardcoding the server's certificate within the application, ensuring that only trusted certificates are accepted, thus reducing the risk of unauthorized interception or tampering of communication.
